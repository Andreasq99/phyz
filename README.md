## Description <a name="description"></a>
A simple n-body physics simulator. Written using the LÖVE API for Lua. I also use this as a background when I stream video games!

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
### Download Executable   
To download the finished app, simply download Phyz.exe from the root directory.
### Install Screen Saver   
To install the program as a screen saver, download the phyz.scr app, right click, and select install.   
### Forking   
To fork the directory, ensure you have LÖVE installed and configured in your PATH variables.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Just install and run! If you are using the source code, once you have LÖVE installed, simply run ```love .``` in your terminal. 

If you'd like to compile your code into a new executable, begin by copying the relevant files to ```~/build/build-staging```. 

Now edit makeLove.batEXAMPLE and change ```Path-to-your-build-directory``` on line 1 to the path to that directory in your computer. For example, the first line of my build file reads ```cd C:\Users\Andreas\GitHub\Phyz\build```. Similarly, you'll want to replace ```Path-to-your-love.exe``` on line 5 with the path to your love executable. Now rename the file to makeLove.bat, and running it will create the new executable in your bin folder!
